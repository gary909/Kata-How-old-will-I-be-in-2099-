    <p>
        Philip's just turned four and he wants to know how old he will be in various years<br> 
        in the future such as 2090 or 3044. His parents can't keep up calculating this so <br>
        they've begged you to help them out by writing a programme that can answer Philip's <br>
        endless questions.<br>
        <br>
        Your task is to write a function that takes two parameters: the year of birth and<br>
        the year to count years in relation to. As Philip is getting more curious every day <br>
        he may soon want to know how many years it was until he would be born, so your <br>
        function needs to work with both dates in the future and in the past.<br>
        <br>
        Provide output in this format: For dates in the future: "You are ... year(s) old."<br>
        For dates in the past: "You will be born in ... year(s)." If the year of birth <br>
        equals the year requested return: "You were born this very year!"<br>
        <br>
        "..." are to be replaced by the number, followed and proceeded by a single space. <br>
        Mind that you need to account for both "year" and "years", depending on the result.<br>
        <br>
        Good Luck!<br>
